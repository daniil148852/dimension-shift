# Dimension Shift

Reality bends around your gameplay. The more you play, the more the world transforms.

## Features

### 🌈 Emotion Engine
The world's color palette dynamically shifts based on your performance:
- **Dying repeatedly** shifts the world toward deep crimson and violet — frustration colors
- **Making progress** blooms warm golds and greens — hope colors  
- **Near-completion** radiates brilliant whites and cyans — triumph colors
- **Perfect runs** create rainbow aurora effects

### 👻 Ghost Trails
Your previous attempts replay as translucent phantoms alongside you. Watch your past selves die at the same spots. Each ghost has a slightly different hue so you can tell attempts apart.

### ⏰ Time Echoes
Objects near your death points start to "glitch" — they slightly wobble, flicker, or shift position visually (not affecting hitboxes). The more you die at a spot, the more distorted reality becomes there. It's like the level remembers your pain.

### 💓 Rhythm Pulse
The entire game world breathes with the music:
- Background scales subtly on bass hits
- Ground line glows on beat
- Objects have micro-animations synced to BPM
- Screen edges vignette pulse

### 💔 Dimension Fractures
When you die, a visual "crack" appears in the world at that position — like you broke reality. Cracks accumulate and glow faintly. Optional persistence across attempts.
